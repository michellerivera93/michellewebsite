<h1>Homework 9: Data Visualization </h1>
<h3>Stats on Social Media- (conducted on small group of Hunter Students) </h3>
<img src="datavis.png" width="900px">



<i><p>I conducted a survey with a population size of 22 students. The three charts represent the students' relationship to social media (how they interact with it, how many hours they spend on it, and which platforms they prefer).</p>
<p> The statistics didn't really surprise me. Prior to the survey, I assumed that most people either spent more time on TikTok or Instagram and were pretty active on social media platforms (more than 3 installed). </p></i>
