	<p> Hi! My name’s Michelle Rivera Perez and I am a sophomore at Hunter College. Although I haven’t created any artwork as of late, I hope to soon. In this work, I aim to showcase the community I grew up in and the people in it who have been influential in my life. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea that every person carries their own world of memories, struggles, and joys, and my art seeks to honor the beauty of those hidden stories that surround us every day.</p>
	<p> My art style is still evolving, but I envision combining figurative imagery with layered textures that suggest complexity and depth. I want my process to reflect listening as much as creating and paying attention to the details of daily life, translating them into colors, lines, or textures that carry emotional weight. My audience is anyone curious about the richness of human experience. Ultimately, I want my work to be an invitation to recognize ourselves in one another.</p>
