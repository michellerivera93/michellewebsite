<i><p>I cut, masked, and layered different facial features from my source images, then rearranged them until they formed a new figure. I used selection tools to pull out eyes, mouths, and textures. I also used the blending modes "Overlay", and "Screen" to help me soften the edges and let shadows and highlights mix so the pictures didn’t look like stiff cutouts. </p>
<p> I wanted this piece to highlight how constant security and surveillance can feel. The rectangles are meant to look like the autofocus boxes you see on cameras, showing how people are always being tracked, tagged, or picked apart by technology. By placing those boxes over different facial features, I was trying to show how surveillance breaks a person into pieces and focuses on certain parts instead of the whole. The collage represents the way modern systems monitor us closely, sometimes without us noticing.</p></i>
