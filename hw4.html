<h1>Homework 4: Photomontage</h1>
<h3>Collage 1</h3>

<i><p>I cut, masked, and layered different facial features from my source images, then rearranged them until they formed a new, surreal figure that felt both funny and unsettling. I used selection tools to pull out eyes, mouths, and textures. Blending modes like Multiply, Overlay, and Screen helped me soften the edges and let shadows and highlights mix so the features didn’t sit on the canvas like stiff cutouts. </p>
<p> I wanted this piece to highlight how constant security and surveillance can feel. The rectangles are meant to look like the autofocus boxes you see on cameras, showing how people are always being tracked, tagged, or picked apart by technology. By placing those boxes over different facial features, I was trying to show how surveillance breaks a person into pieces and focuses on certain parts instead of the whole. The collage represents the way modern systems monitor us closely, sometimes without us noticing.</p></i>

<h3>Collage 2</h3>

<i><p>For this collage, I pulled together images that represent fear, movement, and the uncertainty that surrounds deportation and current ICE raids in the U.S. I used cutouts of people, documents, and symbolic objects, then layered them to show how chaotic and overwhelming the experience can be. I used masking and blending to merge these elements so they felt connected rather than separate, and I chose blending modes like Multiply and Overlay to add weight and tension to the composition. These techniques helped me build a visual environment where everything feels unstable, as if the scene could shift or disappear at any moment—reflecting the way families are often disrupted with little warning.</p>
<p>The message I wanted to send is about the emotional and human impact of these raids. I focused on showing how deportation doesn’t just target one individual—it affects families, communities, and everyday life. I added visual cues that feel like surveillance and threat, such as blurred edges and boxed-in sections, to represent how people are watched and tracked. The goal was to highlight the fear and pressure that many immigrants live with, especially during times when enforcement becomes more aggressive. Even though the collage is symbolic, I wanted it to clearly show that behind the headlines are real people dealing with real consequences. </i>
