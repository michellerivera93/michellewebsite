<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>Photography can be a selective process for me. Oftentimes, the images I take only reflect the happiest moments of my life. I usually just let these images sit in my camera roll and don’t even scroll through them much. I am occasionally reminded of their existence and only then pay attention to them. It is nice to look back on what I was doing and how I was a different version of myself at the time that the image was taken. I use photography to capture moments when I feel really happy, that I love the setting and ambiance of, that I will never be in again. To have something to look back on when I'm old and moldy, to remember not only major events in my life but to freeze time and capture the people around me who may not be around for much longer- whether it be due to old age or any other natural separation.

<p>Image making, on the other hand, is a different, more fun process. I use it to spread information about topics I'm interested in, to make images fit an aesthetic of my choosing, and to create or refine something into a representation of what I find to be visually pleasing.

<p>In this chapter of Sontag’s book, she highlights the idea that we make moments immortal when we photograph them. In this sense, it is important to record what is going on not just in our lives, but in the lives of others around the world. The emotional impact of devastating images from global events reminds us and those in the future to do everything in our power to never repeat the atrocities we have seen. However, when thinking of how I want to bring awareness to these events, I remember another part of this chapter in which Sontag highlights that the repeated exposure of shocking images can desensitize the public and make the horrible seem ordinary. While I do believe it is important for people to be aware of the realities of the world, this information has made me more intent on keeping my work general and open to interpretation rather than displaying blatant suffering in my creations.

<p>When we take photos, we can change different elements like exposure, saturation, or contrast to bring attention to a single subject or object in the photo to enforce a theme or convey a specific message. The addition of text can also take away the uncertainty of what your work is trying to communicate and make the message more straight-forward. For example, putting captions underneath images can give the viewer context and help them understand your artistic choices better. How we crop images also matters because it allows us to omit certain information. Cropping gives us the power to transform what we originally capture into the narrative we wish to tell or re-tell a story all together. This is why I think it is important to be intentional with what we photograph so we can be as truthful as possible.

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>In 2023, I used ChatGPT for the first time. Back then, I was not informed on artificial intelligence or its many uses. I hardly had any idea that the technology I once used to simply complete homework assignments would develop into what it is today. Worried of being fooled by AI (because that can be embarrassing), I question every major headline or video I see on social media. Usually, I think I’m good at deciphering what videos are AI and which ones or not. They all seem to want to be gag-worthy or mine for shock value and they all seem to have this bad quality that resembles CGI when it was in its stages of early development or going into PicsArt and putting a horrible filter over your image, it’s scary. As the article mentions, women have suffered at the expense of this technology, with many of its uses sexualizing little kids cartoons, specifically the characters who are women. </p>
<p>People making deepfakes of female celebrities performing lewd acts is by far the most extreme representation of this that I have heard of. This not only contributes to the objectification of women, but it makes me question how much empathy we have lost or have ever had as a society. Those who make these videos seem to be in competition with one another: who can make the most ridiculous video? Like images, the severity of some AI generated content begins to be grouped with actual images of real people and everything just starts looking the same, everything feels less human. Content starts to become about entertainment and what can grab users attention the most, which,of course, was what it has generally always been about.</p>
