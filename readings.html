<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>Photography can be a selective process for me. Oftentimes, the images I take only reflect the happiest moments of my life. I usually just let these images sit in my camera roll and don’t even scroll through them much. I am occasionally reminded of their existence and only then pay attention to them. It is nice to look back on what I was doing and how I was a different version of myself at the time that the image was taken. I use photography to capture moments when I feel really happy, that I love the setting and ambiance of, that I will never be in again. To have something to look back on when I'm old and moldy, to remember not only major events in my life but to freeze time and capture the people around me who may not be around for much longer- whether it be due to old age or any other natural separation.

<p>Image making, on the other hand, is a different, more fun process. I use it to spread information about topics I'm interested in, to make images fit an aesthetic of my choosing, and to create or refine something into a representation of what I find to be visually pleasing.

<p>In this chapter of Sontag’s book, she highlights the idea that we make moments immortal when we photograph them. In this sense, it is important to record what is going on not just in our lives, but in the lives of others around the world. The emotional impact of devastating images from global events reminds us and those in the future to do everything in our power to never repeat the atrocities we have seen. However, when thinking of how I want to bring awareness to these events, I remember another part of this chapter in which Sontag highlights that the repeated exposure of shocking images can desensitize the public and make the horrible seem ordinary. While I do believe it is important for people to be aware of the realities of the world, this information has made me more intent on keeping my work general and open to interpretation rather than displaying blatant suffering in my creations.

<p>When we take photos, we can change different elements like exposure, saturation, or contrast to bring attention to a single subject or object in the photo to enforce a theme or convey a specific message. The addition of text can also take away the uncertainty of what your work is trying to communicate and make the message more straight-forward. For example, putting captions underneath images can give the viewer context and help them understand your artistic choices better. How we crop images also matters because it allows us to omit certain information. Cropping gives us the power to transform what we originally capture into the narrative we wish to tell or re-tell a story all together. This is why I think it is important to be intentional with what we photograph so we can be as truthful as possible.

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>In 2023, I used ChatGPT for the first time. Back then, I was not informed on artificial intelligence or its many uses. I hardly had any idea that the technology I once used to simply complete homework assignments would develop into what it is today. Worried of being fooled by AI (because that can be embarrassing), I question every major headline or video I see on social media. Usually, I think I’m good at deciphering what videos are AI and which ones or not. They all seem to want to be gag-worthy or mine for shock value and they all seem to have this bad quality that resembles CGI when it was in its stages of early development or going into PicsArt and putting a horrible filter over your image, it’s scary. As the article mentions, women have suffered at the expense of this technology, with many of its uses sexualizing little kids cartoons, specifically the characters who are women. </p>
<p>People making deepfakes of female celebrities performing lewd acts is by far the most extreme representation of this that I have heard of. This not only contributes to the objectification of women, but it makes me question how much empathy we have lost or have ever had as a society. Those who make these videos seem to be in competition with one another: who can make the most ridiculous video? Like images, the severity of some AI generated content begins to be grouped with actual images of real people and everything just starts looking the same, everything feels less human. Content starts to become about entertainment and what can grab users attention the most, which,of course, was what it has generally always been about.</p>

<h3>Reading Response #003: <i>Graphic Novel: Motherhood in Crisis</i></h3>
<p> The illustrations in these comics differ from photographs in several important ways. While photographs capture a single, literal moment in time, the illustrations feel more interpretive and emotionally focused. Many of the drawings zoom in on the women’s faces, emphasizing lines, wrinkles, and expressions that communicate exhaustion, resilience, or strength. These artistic choices guide the viewer’s attention toward emotion rather than setting, allowing the reader to pause and fully absorb what the woman is feeling in that moment. Unlike photographs, which can sometimes feel distant or observational, the illustrations feel intentional and intimate. 
Another key difference is that the illustrations “freeze” moments in a way that photographs cannot fully achieve within a narrative sequence. Each panel holds a specific emotion or experience, giving the reader time to reflect before moving on. This slowing down of time helps emphasize the weight of the women’s stories, especially when discussing hardship, labor, or loss. Because the illustrations are part of a comic format, they also work together with the text rather than competing with it. I found myself paying closer attention to the words because the visuals supported the story instead of overwhelming it.
Compared to text alone, the illustrations provide visual context that makes the stories more accessible and emotionally engaging. Reading about these women’s lives without imagery would require the reader to imagine everything on their own, which can unintentionally create emotional distance. The illustrations help bridge that gap by offering a visual anchor, making the experiences feel more real while still allowing room for interpretation.
The inclusion of photographs, especially when videos were shown, added another layer to this experience. Seeing what the women actually look like broke the sense of detachment that can sometimes come with illustrated stories. It reminded me that these were not fictional characters but real women with real lives. This combination of illustration and photography was especially powerful because it balanced emotional interpretation with reality, ultimately humanizing the women even further.
 </p>
<p>Another advantage of using illustrated comics rather than photography alone is the sense of safety and dignity they provide to the women being represented. Illustrations allow the artists to share deeply personal stories without exposing the subjects to the vulnerability that direct photography can sometimes create. Instead of feeling like the women are being observed or documented from the outside, the illustrations feel collaborative and respectful, as if their stories are being carefully translated rather than taken. This approach shifts the focus away from spectacle and toward understanding. By choosing illustration, the creators avoid reducing these women to images of suffering and instead present them as complex individuals with voices, agency, and lived experience. This makes the stories feel less like distant documentation and more like intentional acts of storytelling.
Overall, the illustrations present a unique advantage over text-only or photography alone by creating empathy through both storytelling and visual emotion. They allow the reader to engage deeply, reflect longer, and connect more personally with the women’s experiences, even from halfway across the world.

<h3>Reading Response #004: <i>Graphic Novel: Motherhood in Crisis</i></h3>
<p> In The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, W. J. Hennigan discusses the growing dangers created by modern warfare and advancing technology, but what stayed with me most was how human the consequences of these systems really are. The article made me realize how easy it is to think of risk as something distant or theoretical, when in reality it directly affects people who have little control over the decisions being made. Reading this, I felt a growing sense of discomfort knowing that the systems meant to protect society can also be the ones putting lives at risk.
One of the most unsettling parts of the article was the idea that technology is advancing faster than our ability to responsibly manage it. There is a strong reliance on automated systems and advanced weapons, which creates a false sense of security. Instead of making us safer, these tools often remove human judgment and accountability. What scared me most was the idea that when something goes wrong, responsibility becomes blurred. It feels easier to blame the system rather than the people who designed or approved it, which allows the same risks to continue.
The article also made me think about how often society waits for something catastrophic to happen before taking action. Hennigan emphasizes prevention, and that stood out to me because it highlights how much harm could be avoided if warning signs were taken seriously. This made me reflect on how complacency plays a role in risk. When danger becomes normalized or invisible, it is easier to ignore, even when the consequences are severe. That realization made the article feel urgent rather than informative.
What I appreciated most was that the article did not rely on fear to make its point. Instead, it encouraged responsibility, transparency, and human involvement in decision making. It reminded me that technology should never replace ethical judgment. Progress is often framed as something inherently good, but this article pushed me to question who benefits from that progress and who is left vulnerable because of it.
Overall, The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It left me feeling more aware of how interconnected responsibility and safety really are. It reinforced the idea that we do not exist only to protect ourselves, but to consider how our systems and choices affect others. Much like other readings in this course, the article emphasized the importance of empathy and accountability, especially when decisions are being made on a scale that impacts countless lives.</p>
