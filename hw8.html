<h1>Homework 8: Animated GIFs </h1>
<h3>Exhausted Eyes </h3>

<i><p> Making this GIF was pretty fun because I got to capture how I've been feeling this week. Learning how to use the timeline feature was kind of tricky but once I realized what to do, putting the layers together was manageable.  </p></i>

  
<h3>Peanut & Jelly</h3>

<i><p> For this GIF, I created a peanut coming out of a jar of jelly and blowing a kiss. Much like my other works, there isn't crazy significance or rationale behind my decision to create this (mostly for the cuteness factor). </p></i>
